# Improvement Tasks for SUPER_PRUEBA Project

Below is an enumerated checklist of actionable improvement tasks for the project. These tasks are logically ordered and cover both architectural and code-level improvements.

## Architecture Improvements

1. [ ] **Implement a proper layered architecture**
   - [ ] Clearly separate presentation, business logic, and data access layers
   - [ ] Define clear interfaces between layers
   - [ ] Ensure unidirectional dependencies (UI → Business Logic → Data Access)

2. [ ] **Implement dependency injection**
   - [ ] Add a dependency injection framework (e.g., Spring)
   - [ ] Remove direct instantiation of DAOs in controllers
   - [ ] Configure dependencies in a central location

3. [ ] **Improve database connection management**
   - [ ] Implement a connection pool (e.g., HikariCP)
   - [ ] Fix the typo in `ConecctionDataBase` class name
   - [ ] Move database configuration to a more standard location
   - [ ] Use a more flexible configuration approach (not hardcoded paths)

4. [ ] **Implement proper error handling and validation**
   - [ ] Create custom exceptions for different error scenarios
   - [ ] Implement consistent error handling across the application
   - [ ] Add input validation in service layer before database operations

5. [ ] **Add comprehensive logging**
   - [ ] Implement consistent logging across all layers
   - [ ] Configure different log levels for development and production
   - [ ] Add transaction IDs to logs for traceability

6. [ ] **Implement unit and integration testing**
   - [ ] Set up a testing framework (JUnit, TestFX for UI)
   - [ ] Create unit tests for business logic
   - [ ] Create integration tests for database operations
   - [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline for automated testing

## Code-Level Improvements

7. [ ] **Improve code organization**
   - [ ] Standardize naming conventions (e.g., consistent use of camelCase)
   - [ ] Organize imports consistently
   - [ ] Remove unused imports and code
   - [ ] Add proper Javadoc comments to classes and methods

8. [ ] **Enhance data access layer**
   - [ ] Implement transactions for operations that modify multiple tables
   - [ ] Use prepared statements consistently to prevent SQL injection
   - [ ] Handle database resources properly (ensure all connections are closed)
   - [ ] Implement pagination for large result sets

9. [ ] **Improve DTO and entity classes**
   - [ ] Implement proper equals() and hashCode() methods for all DTOs
   - [ ] Add validation annotations to DTO fields
   - [ ] Consider using Lombok to reduce boilerplate code
   - [ ] Implement proper toString() methods for debugging

10. [ ] **Enhance UI components**
    - [ ] Implement responsive design for all screens
    - [ ] Add input validation in UI forms
    - [ ] Improve error messages shown to users
    - [ ] Implement internationalization (i18n) for UI text

11. [ ] **Improve security**
    - [ ] Implement proper authentication and authorization
    - [ ] Secure database credentials (don't store in plain text)
    - [ ] Implement CSRF protection for web forms
    - [ ] Add input sanitization to prevent XSS attacks

12. [ ] **Optimize performance**
    - [ ] Profile the application to identify bottlenecks
    - [ ] Optimize database queries (add indexes, review query plans)
    - [ ] Implement caching for frequently accessed data
    - [ ] Reduce unnecessary database calls

13. [ ] **Refactor GUI controllers**
    - [ ] Extract common functionality to base classes
    - [ ] Implement the MVC pattern more strictly
    - [ ] Separate UI logic from business logic
    - [ ] Reduce code duplication in controllers

14. [ ] **Improve exception handling in GUI**
    - [ ] Show user-friendly error messages
    - [ ] Log detailed error information for debugging
    - [ ] Prevent application crashes due to unhandled exceptions
    - [ ] Implement graceful degradation for non-critical errors

15. [ ] **Enhance project documentation**
    - [ ] Create comprehensive README with setup instructions
    - [ ] Document architecture and design decisions
    - [ ] Add inline code documentation
    - [ ] Create user documentation for the application
